# Dragging/Resizing Demo

An attempt at implement resizing and dragging using native javascript. 

To activate, double click any image or mulitple images to resize, move or edit the margin of any images.  To finish resizing, dragging or margin editing, click once within the content-editable div.  Theoretically, any image style that can be edited via DOM-manip can have this functionality, although some may be less practical than others.
